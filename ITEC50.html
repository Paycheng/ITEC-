      <li>What is the URL of the site?</li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?app=desktop&fbclid=IwAR32erVWUvH1c-ODT6hjsBn_1Y8anljpgh3QcJMaxsTtVPgtdX1rMwgHFF8">
      YouTube.com</a>
      <li>What is the purpose of the site?</li>
      <p>-The purpose of this site is to entertain the viewers that are finding ways to kill time and some other people using this site to make videos about their life or some other creators are using this as a work income.</p>
      <li>Who is the intended audience?</li>
      <p>-The intended audience of this site is the people finding ways to kill time. People who need to have an entertainment platform to their house when they're alone.</p>
      <li>Do you think that the site reaches its intended audience? Why or why not?</li>
      <p>-For me, I think YouTube reaches its intended audience because it is super popular right now. Other television platforms are switching to this site because they don't need to pay for the content that they're posting and they're having an income here to thru ads.</p>
      <li>Is the site useful to you? Why or why not?</li>
      <p>-For me it is very useful because it helps me to do my studies when I don't know the topic or I don't get it and sometimes It helps me to kill time.</p>
      <li>Does this site appeal to you? Why or why not? Consider the use of color, images, multimedia, organization, and ease of navigation.</li>
      <p>-For me it's appealing when you see a red logo with a play button in it you know already that it's YouTube. The images that they're calling it a thumbnail it gives us idea on whatâ€™s on the video and what is the content of this video.</p>
      <li>Would you encourage others to visit this site? Why or why not?</li>
      <p>-I don't think that I need to encourage someone to visit this site because this site is really popular today.</p>
      <li>How could this site be improved?</li>
      <p>-I think for me YouTube need to improve in terms of the warnings in age restriction because many of the contents in YouTube are not for the kids and it is very accessible just create another email account and they just need to change their age.</p>
